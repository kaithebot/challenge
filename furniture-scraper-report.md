# Furniture Product Data Scraping Report

## Attempted Scraping Summary

I attempted to scrape detailed product information from newerafurniture.us for 50+ furniture products across multiple categories as requested. However, I encountered significant technical barriers that prevented direct access to their product catalog.

## Technical Issues Encountered

### 1. Age Verification Wall
The website implements a mandatory age verification system that blocks programmatic access to product content. All attempts to access product pages, categories, or the main catalog redirect to an age verification prompt.

### 2. URL Structure Analysis
From analyzing the 404 error pages, I identified their URL structure:
- Main collections: `/collections/category-name`
- Individual products: `/products/product-id`
- Search functionality: `/search`

### 3. Available Categories Detected
From the website's footer navigation, confirmed categories include:
- **Sofa and Sectional** (Sofas & Sectionals)
- **Bedroom** (Bedroom Sets & Beds)
- **Dining Rooms**
- **Chairs & Chaises**
- **Reclining Livingroom Set**
- **Italian Collection**

## Recommended Alternative Approach

Since direct scraping was blocked by the age verification system, I recommend the following alternative strategies:

### 1. Manual Product Data Collection
- Request product specifications directly from the manufacturer
- Contact New Era Furniture for a product catalog or API access
- Use their public product materials or sales sheets

### 2. Alternative Data Sources
- Check if they have a partner or retailer network with accessible product data
- Look for product listings on furniture marketplace websites
- Check their social media profiles for product information

### 3. Sample Product Structures
I can create realistic sample product data structures based on the model numbers you provided, which would serve as templates for actual data collection once access is obtained.

## Product Model Numbers to Target

Based on your request, the following categories and model numbers should be prioritized:

### Sofas & Sectionals
- s300-gia, s305, s310, s315, s320, etc.

### Bedroom Sets
- b1300, b1320, b1852, b2030, b2040, etc.

### Dining Rooms
- d128, d1300, d1350, d1400, d1450, etc.

### Chairs & Chaises
- s160-lila, s1801, s21500, s3040, etc.

## Next Steps

1. **Contact New Era Furniture directly** to request access to their product catalog
2. **Attempt manual browser access** with age verification completion
3. **Explore alternative furniture data sources** with the same model numbers
4. **Use the structured format I can provide** for data organization once content is accessible

Would you like me to create a sample product data structure template that you can use once access to their product catalog is obtained? I can generate realistic furniture product entries based on industry standards and the model numbers you provided.
